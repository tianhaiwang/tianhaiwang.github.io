This robot is designed to perform random movement indoors and real-time object detection, which can check whether there are suspicious persons in the room. In this project, I am the team leader and mainly responsible for the development of 3D modeling, object detection, and Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). In a ministerial-level innovation competition, our team won the second prize.
