# üõ†Ô∏è Current Project - Digital Twin and Virtual Reality for Orchard Robotics

The primary objective of this research is to develop a highly integrated autonomous field robot system capable of precision pruning in smart orchards, including machine vision system development, automatic navigation system development, and end-effector control system development.

Ultimately, we aim to achieve [Embodied AI](https://lamarr-institute.org/blog/embodied-ai-explained/) systems based on end-to-end [Vision-Language-Action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision-language-action_model) models.

At the beginning, we focus on constructing simulation environments for the training and testing of robots through [Digital Twin](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/what-is-a-digital-twin) and [Virtual Reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality), designing a 3D [World Foundation Model](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/world-models/) for orchards, and providing a systematic and comprehensive benchmark dataset for the field of agricultural engineering.

- ## Multi-agent collaboration and obstacle avoidance system for wheat production

This work focuses on <u>object detection and tracking</u> based on multi-sensor fusion in unstructured farmland environment. Especially, I'm dedicated to realizing the detection of unknown objects in open environment via <u>few/zero-shot learning</u>, <u>open set recognition</u>, etc. 

In addition, I participated in the development of <u>multi-agent collaborative system</u> as a main member. In this project, I am responsible for <u>path planning and task allocation algorithms</u> in the harvesting-unloading-transportation process of wheat production. According to constraints of plot location, task number, operation time window, and path planning, intelligent scheduling model was established based on <u>non-dominated sorting genetic and colony algorithms</u>.
