### Multi-agent collaboration and obstacle avoidance system for wheat production

I'm work on object detection and tracking based on multi-sensor fusion in unstructured farmland environment. Especially, I'm dedicated to realizing the detection of unknown objects in open environment via few/zero-shot learning, open set recognition, etc. In addition, I participated in the development of multi-agent collaborative systems as a main member.

This work is being supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China:

- Research and development of common key technology and system for corn unmanned operation (Grant No. 2022YFD2001601, CNY 4.0 million)

- Research and development of cloud management and control platform for rice unmanned operation (Grant No. 2021YFD2000604, CNY 6.0 million)
