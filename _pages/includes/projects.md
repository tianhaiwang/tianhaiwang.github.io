# üõ†Ô∏è Current Project - Multi-agent collaboration and obstacle avoidance system for wheat production

I'm work on <u>object detection and tracking</u> based on multi-sensor fusion in unstructured farmland environment. Especially, I'm dedicated to realizing the detection of unknown objects in open environment via <u>few/zero-shot learning</u>, <u>open set recognition</u>, etc. 

In addition, I participated in the development of <u>multi-agent collaborative system</u> as a main member. In this project, I am responsible for <u>path planning and task allocation algorithms</u> in the harvesting-unloading-transportation process of wheat production. According to constraints of plot location, task number, operation time window, and path planning, intelligent scheduling model was established based on <u>non-dominated sorting genetic and colony algorithms</u>.
