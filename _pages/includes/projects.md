I'm work on object detection and tracking based on multi-sensor fusion in unstructured farmland environment. Especially, I'm dedicated to realizing the detection of unknown objects in open environment via zero-shot learning, open set recognition, etc.

This work is being supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China:

- Common key technology and system research and development of corn unmanned operation (Grant No. 2022YFD2001601, CNY 4.0 million)

- Research and development of cloud management and control platform for rice full unmanned farm production (Grant No. 2021YFD2000604, CNY 6.0 million)
