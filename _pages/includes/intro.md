# ðŸ˜ƒ About Me
Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at the [Laboratory of Field Phenomics](https://lab.fieldphenomics.com/) at The University of Tokyo. I obtained my M.Eng. degree from College of Information and Electrical Engineering, [China Agricultural University](http://en.cau.edu.cn/), where I work on automatic perception and navigation for agricultural robots, including object detection and tracking, zero-shot learning, LiDAR-camera panoramic fusion, etc. Before that, I obtained my B.Eng. degree from School of Mechanical Engineering, [Guangxi University](https://english.gxu.edu.cn/) in June, 2021.

If you are seeking any form of academic cooperation, please feel free to email me at [tianhai.wang@fieldphenomics.com](mailto:tianhai.wang@fieldphenomics.com).

**Research interest:** obstacle avoidance, multi-agent/robot collaboration, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), object detection and tracking, semantic and instance segmentation, LiDAR-camera panoramic fusion, and related applications such as autonomous vehicles, field robotics, plant phenotyping, and smart agriculture.

<!-- **Announcement:** I'm looking for a challenging and satisfying Ph.D. position that will commensurate with educational background. -->
