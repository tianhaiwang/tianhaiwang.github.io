I'm currently a MPhil student at College of Information and Electrical Engineering, [China Agricultural University](http://en.cau.edu.cn/), where I work on automatic navigation for agricultural robots, including object detection and tracking, zero-shot learning, LiDAR-camera fusion, etc. Before that, I obtained my B.S. from School of Mechanical Engineering, [Guangxi University](https://english.gxu.edu.cn/) in June, 2021.

If you are seeking any form of academic cooperation, please feel free to email me at [tianhaiwang@cau.edu.cn](mailto:tianhaiwang@cau.edu.cn).

**Research interest:** object detection and tracking, zero-shot learning, open set recognition, LiDAR-camera fusion, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and related applications such as robot navigation and smart agriculture.


**Announcement:** I'm looking for a challenging and satisfying Ph.D. position (Fall 2024) that will commensurate with educational background.
