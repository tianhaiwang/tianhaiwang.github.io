    This paper proposes a novel 3D detection method for agricultural obstacles with few or zero samples based on multi-modality feature representation mechanism. Specifically, image and point cloud attitude adjusters are integrated to enhance the accuracy, reliability, and uniformity of multi-modality data. Semantic and geometry-intensity feature encoders are integrated to capture essential relationships among categories. The Bird‚Äôs Eye View (BEV) fusion decoder is designed to discern intra-category similarities and inter-category distinctions.

    By introducing the concept of one-shot domain adaptation, the proposed method enables 3D obstacle detection with just one sample per category. By learning the intra-category similarity and inter-category difference, the dependence on the target domain dataset is transferred to the accessible source domain dataset, which enhances the generalization of the proposed method for different scenes and categories.

    In the absence of annotated images, the current methods cannot perform optimally. Based on the visual‚Äêsemantic mapping relationship, the proposed model not only performs the correct classification of unseen obstacles, but also improves the detection performance of both seen and unseen obstacles.

    In Part ‚Ö† of this two-part paper, the primary focus was to address the issue of collaborative scheduling for harvesters through task allocation and whole-process path planning. In Part II, the emphasis shifts to addressing the collaborative scheduling and planning of both harvesters and grain trucks while considering the efficiency of grain trucks.

    This study addresses the challenge of autonomous navigation path planning for achieving complete coverage operations using agricultural machines within harvest operation scenarios. We proposed a hybrid method mixing nested and spiral method to solve path planning problems for convex polygonal plots during harvest operations, focusing on the development of path planning models and complete coverage path planning (CCPP) method.

    The farm‚Äôs electronic map was constructed using the topological map method. The improved Dijkstra algorithm based on priority queues was combined with three different complete coverage methods: the nested method, the reciprocating method, and the combination of nested and internal spiral path methods. To solve the problem of illogical scheduling of the same type of agricultural machines, an improved ant colony method was presented based on the whole working path to minimize the path cost.
